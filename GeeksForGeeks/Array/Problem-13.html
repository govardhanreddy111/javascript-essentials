    <title>Chocolate Distribution Problem</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Given an array of n integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Each student gets one packet.</li>
    <li>The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.</li>
</ol>

        arr.sort(function (a,b) {
            return a-b;

        var minimum = arr[count-1]-arr[0];
